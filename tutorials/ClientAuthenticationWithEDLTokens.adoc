== Overview
Using EDL tokens for authentication is usually straight forward when the software
making the requests has an API/UI that allows the injection of an HTTP request
header. All the data access clients that we have been tested with EDL
authentication have been working because the EDL authentication endpoints support
the most fundamental type of web authentication, HTTP BASIC.

The introduction of EDL tokens means a move away from HTTP BASIC authentication
and into something new. Some very flexible clients like `cURL` and `wget` can
easily adapt to the change in authentication procedure by simply taking an EDL
token and submitting it as part of an Authorization request header.

Other data access client software have no API or UI through which an EDL token
might be introduced and used in an authorization header.

NOTE: Recent changes in the way that the Hyrax DAP service utilizes EDL tokens
means that clients are no longer required to follow redirects or maintain
session state by managing cookies. However, maintaining session state
(managing cookies) will produce better request performance when your client is
making multiple requests of the service. If a session is not maintained by the
requesting client the service will validate the EDL token each time a request is
made. This may add 500ms - 2000ms to every request/response cycle.

== Acquire an EDL token from the EDL service
This is an activity that you must do by hand, with a browser.

* Point you browser here: https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile
image:EDL_Profile_Page.png[EDL Profile]

* Click the `Generate Token` link.
* Now you should be at the `Generate a Bearer Token` page
image:EDL_Generate_Token_Page_1.png[EDL Generate Bearer Token]

* Click the big green `Generate Token` button.
* Consider the resulting page:

Copy the token into your clipboard and save it in a local file for safe keeping.
Also, for the purposes of this guide, make a file called `edl_token_auth.hdr` and
in the file put this line:
----
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_VALUE
----

== _curl_ (Command line _cURL_)

Recent changes in the way that the Hyrax service utilizes EDL tokens means that
the clients are no longer required to follow redirects or maintain session state
by managing cookies.

Here are two examples with command line cURL. One that uses EDL tokens and
maintains sessions and a second that uses only the EDL


=== cURL with EDL Token and session cookies.
You can utilize your EDL token with a commandline cURL request that will
maintain a session so that subsequent requests will be serviced more quickly.
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
# cURL example, uses sessions, no redirects.
#
export url="https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds"
echo "url: ${url}" >&2

# Load the EDL token file contents into the shell variable 'auth_hdr'
export auth_hdr=$(cat edl_token_auth.hdr)
echo "auth_hdr: ${auth_hdr}" >&2

curl -c ~/cookie_file -b ~/cookie_file -H "${auth_hdr}" "${url}"
----

What is happening here?

`-c cookie_file`:: This tells _cURL_ to stash cookies in the file _cookie_file_

`-b cookie_file`:: This tells _cURL_ to read cookies from the file _cookie_file_

`-H` "${auth_hdr}":: The -H option adds its parameter value as a request header in
the HTTP request sent to the origin server, `${url}` in the example above.
Because the Authorization header contains space characters, the double quotes
around the value *required*.

`${url}`:: The URL to dereference and retrieve.

NOTE: The client need not follow redirects (`-L`) for the Hyrax DAP service. With
other servers ymmv.

=== cURL with only the EDL Token.
You can utilize your EDL token with a command line cURL request without
maintaining sessions.
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
# cURL example, no session, no redirects.
#
export url="https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds"
echo "url: ${url}" >&2

# Load the EDL token file contents into the shell variable 'auth_hdr'
export auth_hdr=$(cat edl_token_auth.hdr)
echo "auth_hdr: ${auth_hdr}" >&2

curl -H "${auth_hdr}" "${url}"
----

What is happening here?

`-H` "${auth_hdr}":: The -H option adds its parameter value as a request header in
the HTTP request sent to the origin server, `${url}` in the example above.
Because the Authorization header contains space characters, the double quotes
around the value are a must.

`${url}`:: The URL to dereference and retrieve.

NOTE: The client need not follow redirects (`-L`) for the Hyrax DAP service. With
other servers ymmv.

== _wget_

In this example we will also utilize the `edl_token_auth.hdr` file that we
created earlier. And, like in the cURL example there will be two examples, one
in which wget maintains a session using cookies, and one where it does not. And,
as with cURL, the maintaining a session will provide better performance on
subsequent requests.

=== `wget` with EDL Token and a session.

Consider this _wget_ command:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
export url="https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.das"
echo "url: ${url}" >&2

export auth_hdr=$(cat edl_token_auth.hdr)
echo "auth_hdr: ${auth_hdr}" >&2

wget --load-cookies cookie_file --save-cookies cookie_file --keep-session-cookie --header="${auth_hdr}" "${url}"
----
What's happening with `wget` here?

`--load-cookies cookies` :: Load cookies from the file "cookie_file"
`--save-cookies cookies` :: Save cookies to the file "cookie_file"
`--keep-session-cookie` :: Save session cookies.
`--header "${auth_hdr}"` :: Send the value of the environment variable `auth_hdr`
along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP request.  The supplied header
is sent as-is, which means it must contain name and value separated by colon,
and must not contain newlines.
`${url}`:: The URL to retrieve, in this case
https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.das

=== `wget` with only the EDL Token.

Consider this _wget_ command:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
export url="https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.das"
echo "url: ${url}" >&2

export auth_hdr=$(cat edl_token_auth.hdr)
echo "auth_hdr: ${auth_hdr}" >&2

wget --header="${auth_hdr}" "${url}"
----
What's happening with `wget` here?

`--header "${auth_hdr}"` :: Send the value of the environment variable `auth_hdr`
along with the rest of the headers in each HTTP request.  The supplied header
is sent as-is, which means it must contain name and value separated by colon,
and must not contain newlines.
`${url}`:: The URL to retrieve, in this case
https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.das


== _PyDAP_

Summary ::
Because PyDAP allows the programmer to inject a Session object with customized
request headers it is pretty straight forward to utilize an EDL token when
making requests.

[source,python]
----
# Importing the star of our show, PyDAP!
import pydap

print ("dataset_url: ", dataset_url)

# This gets the EDL token from the users keyboard.
edl_token=input("EDL Token Value: ")
print("EDL Token: ", edl_token);

auth_hdr="Bearer "+edl_token
print("auth_hdr: ", auth_hdr);

# PyDAP accepts a Session, so we make a Session and give it the Authorization
# header:

my_session = requests.Session()
my_session.headers={"Authorization", auth_hdr}

pd_dataset = pydap.client.open_url(dataset_url, session=my_session, protocol="dap4")

== Clients that do not work with EDL tokens
:leveloffset: +1

== _ncdump_, _nccopy_, _Matlab_, and other applications that use _NetCDF-C_

Neither of the usage statements from `nccopy` and `ncdump` contain any mention
of submitting arbitrary headers, or authorization headers through their
published command line interface.

We may need to make a request to UNIDATA to add a request header injection UI
to the NetCDF tools because until this is resolved existing NetCDF client will
be able to work with EDL tokens.


== _Panoply_, _ToolsUI_, _Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)_

None of these GUI driven data access clients contain a GUI component that
allows the user to either submit an authorization header or EDL token value.
Nor do they have a mechanism through which a user may identify an authorization
header or token file. Until these applications GUIs or their configuration
interface have been changed to utilize tokens these applications will be unable
to authenticate with EDL without using HTTP BASIC authentication (including an
expected 401 response from the EDL endpoint) and traditional credentials.
