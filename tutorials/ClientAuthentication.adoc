== Overview
This document describes how to configure DAP clients to access data servers
that require users to be authenticated. The document is divided into four
sections. This Overview provides a brief introduction to the topic and some
background on commonly used clients. The remaining sections provide information
on three different authentication systems in use today: NASA's Earthdata Login,
LDAP, and Shibboleth.

Many users access DAP servers using a browser as their primary software
interface. However, there is also a growing group of users that utilize either:

* A "smart" tool. Where "smart" means that the tool understands how to interact
with a DAP service and construct DAP queries for data and use that in higher
level client side activities like GUI based graphs, image display, selection,
navigation, etc.

* A command line tool such as "wget" or "curl" that can be used to extract data
from a DAP service, but the URL construction is left to the user or other software.

In both these cases we want these client software applications to be able to
manage authentication. In the case of command line style tools, being able
to authenticate without a user interaction is important for automated work
flows.

////
All of these automated clients rely on HTTP BASIC authentication. One
significant facet of this is that the authentication server MUST return an HTTP
401 status to the client in order to trigger the client to resubmit the request
with credentials associated with the 401 endpoint. While the username and
password are sent to the server as "plain-text", if the connection to the server
is over TLS (HTTPS) then the authentication information is encrypted over the
wire.
////

=== Some DAP Data Access Clients
The collection of software clients discussed here have some remarkable
similarities in the way that they handle the client end of
authentication. The clients that present a GUI to the user (Panoply, IDV, and
ToolsUI) will open a dialog box and prompt the user for credentials when the
server requires user authentication. The rest of these clients listed here use
a file called `.netrc` to store credentials. The `.netrc` file is a simple text
file and is described in detail in <<netrc,Our friend, the _.netrc_ file>>.

Some DAP client software applications (those that utilize one of UNIDATA's
NetCDF libraries to provide remote data access) will use the `.dodsrc` file to
store important authentication related information. The `.dodsrc` file is a simple
text file and is typically located in the users home directory. See
<<dodsrc,_ncdump_, _nccopy_, _Matlab_, and other applications that use _NetCDF-C_>>
for more information about the `.dodsrc` file.

We tested each of the authentication steps on the folowing applications:

* _**https://curl.se[cURL (a.k.a. lib_curl or curl)]**_
https://curl.se[The cURL library] provides the HTTP functionality for a surprisingly large part
the world wide web. The cURL library also has a command line application, `curl`,
that can be used to issue HTTP requests and collect the responses. It can be a
very powerful data access tool when used manually or in the scope of a larger
shell script.
** _Credentials_: _**~/.netrc**_
** _Uses ~/.dodsrc_: _**no**_

* _**https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/[ncdump, nccopy, netCDF4
Python, Matlab, and other applications using NetCDF-C]**_
The `ncdump` and `nccopy` command line applications are part of
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/[the NetCDF-C
library] and can be utilized to access DAP resources. This means we can use
`ncdump` and `nccopy` as an easy sanity check for authentication issues for
command line applications that uses the netCDF-C library. Because the netCDF-C
library is the software component that is performing the authentication, the
configuration steps outlined here should directly translate to any application
that uses netCDF-C. These steps were tested against netCDF-C version 4.9.0.
If you have a different version you may wish to visit Unidata for the related
documentation.
** _Credentials_: _**~/.netrc**_
** _Uses ~/.dodsrc_: _**yes**_

* _**https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/[Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)]**_
https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/[The Integrated Data Viewer] is GUI
driven data client that is based around the
CDM/NetCDF data model and utilizes that NetCDF-Java (and thus the Java DAP
implementation) to access remote DAP datasets. Because it has a GUI it can
retrieve (and cache for later) users credentials directly from the user.
Since IDV utilizes the Java-NetCDF library to access DAP resources then in
theory if it works for IDV then it should work for all the other clients that
use the Java-NetCDF library.
** _Credentials_: _**GUI**_
** _Uses ~/.dodsrc_: _**no**_

* _**https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/current/userguide/toolsui_ref.html[ToolsUI]**_
https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/current/userguide/toolsui_ref.html[
The ToolsUI application]
is a simple is GUI driven data client that is based
around the CDM/NetCDF data model and utilizes that NetCDF-Java (and thus the
Java DAP implementation) to access remote DAP datasets. Because it has a GUI
it can retrieve (and cache for later) users credentials directly from the user.
** _Credentials_: _**GUI**_
** _Uses ~/.dodsrc_: _**no**_

* _**https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/[Panoply]**_
https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/[The Panoply application] is a
sophisticated GUI driven data client that is based
around the CDM/NetCDF data model and utilizes that NetCDF-Java (and thus the
Java DAP implementation) to access remote DAP datasets. Because it has a GUI it
can retrieve (and cache for later) users credentials directly from the user.
** _Credentials_: _**GUI**_
** _Uses ~/.dodsrc_: _**no**_

* _**https://github.com/pydap/pydap[PyDAP]**_
https://github.com/pydap/pydap[The PyDAP python software package] provides one
interface for python programs to read from OpenDAP servers (another is the
netCDF4 Python module, which uses the netCDF-C library to actually access data,
including data from OpenDAP servers).
** _Credentials_: _**~/.netrc**_
** _Uses ~/.dodsrc_: _**no**_

[id=netrc]
=== Our friend, the `.netrc` file
The `~/.netrc` file (a file named _**.netrc**_ located in your home directory,
aka **~**) is the way in which many of the data access clients discussed
here expect (i.e., are coded) to access credentials to be used in an
authentication exchange.

Because the `.netrc` file name starts with a dot, it is a hidden file and
will not be visible in a standard directory listing. You can use the `ls -a`
command to see all files in a directory, including hidden files.

Add login credentials for various servers to the `~/.netrc` file, associating each
set of credentials with the appropriate login endpoint. Here is an Earth Data
Login example:

[source,apache]
----
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
	login your_edl_uid
	password your_edl_password
----

And you can add more credentials and machines (aka single sign-on endpoints) as needed:
[source,apache]
----
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
	login your_edl_uid
	password your_edl_password

machine sso.noaa.gov
	login your_noaa_uid
	password your_noaa_password

machine some.ldap.service.edu
	login your_ldap_uid
	password your_ldap_password
----

NOTE: It is crucial that the access permissions be set to allow reading and
writing only by the account owner. This can be done using the command:
`chmod 600 ~/.netrc`
If _group_ or _other_ are allowed any access to the `~/.netrc` file the data
access client software will ignore (possibly silently) the `~/.netrc`
file and authentication will fail.

== Earthdata Login (OAuth2)
Earthdata Login is a NASA implementation of an OAuth2 Single Sign-On service.
In order to access NASA held data you will need to:

1. Obtain (for free) your own set of https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new[
Earthdata Login credentials].
2. _Approve_ the DAP server application that is serving the data you want, as
described in the following section.
3. Use this guide to configure your DAP client of choice (_curl_, browser,
etc.) to utilize these credentials.

=== Setting Up Earthdata Login

==== Acquire Earthdata Login Credentials
Registering with Earthdata Login (EDL) and getting a
user account is free. Point you browser at the
https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new[Earthdata Login New User]
page and do the stuff that needs the doing.

==== Approving The Hyrax OPeNDAP Service Application

Regardless of which software client you decide to employ, before you can access
any new Earthdata Login authenticated server you must first add that sever to
the list of *Approved Applications* in your Earthdata Login profile.

To do this you will need the Earthdata Login Application name (aka UID) under
which the DAP server is registered with Earthdata Login and your Earthdata
Login credentials.

* With your browser, navigate to your
https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile[Earthdata Login profile page.]
* Click the *Applications* tab and select *Authorized Applications* from the
pull down menu.This will take you to the *Approved Applications* page.

image::EDL-Approved-Apps.png[Earthdata Login Approve Applications Page,640,480,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

On the *Approved Applications* page:

* At the bottom of the page click the *Approve More Applications* button.
This will display the *Approve Applications* page.

image::EDL-Approve-Apps-Application-Search.png[Earthdata Login Approve Applications Page,  640,480,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

In the search bar at the top of the page enter the name of the Hyrax OPeNDAP
service application, *_Hyrax in the cloud_* and then click the *Search* button,
this will bring you to the Earthdata Login Application Approval page:

image::EDL-Approve-Apps-Application-Authorize.png[Earthdata Login Application Approval Page, 640,480,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

* Click the _Authorize_ button associated with the *Hyrax in the cloud_* service.
You will be returned to the *My Applications* page where you should now see your
new application on the list of _Approved Applications_.

NOTE: The application named *Hyrax in the cloud* used in this example is the
only OPeNDAP service application running in the NASA cloud. There are many other
applications deployed in NASA and to use any of them with your EDL user account
you will have to authorize each application service in a similar manner
to *_Hyrax in the cloud_*

=== _cURL_ (a.k.a. _lib_curl_ or _curl_)
You can use command line _curl_ to retrieve EDL authenticated resources
using the following technique.

Create a `~/.netrc` file as described in <<netrc,the .netrc section above>>

Edit the `~/.netrc` file and associated your EDL credentials with the EDL
service endpoint utilized by your target DAP server:

[source,apache]
----
machine urs.earthdata.nasa.gov
	login your_edl_uid
	password your_edl_password
----

If the configuration is correct you should now be able to retrieve a DDS object
in from the associated DAP service with the following _curl_ command:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
touch cookie_file
curl -n -c cookie_file -b cookie_file -L --url https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds
----
What is happening here? :: In this request cURL is both authenticating and
maintaining a session with the remote server (this is accomplished by telling
cURL to load and save cookies from the same file, _cookie_file_ )

`-n` :: This tells _cURL_ to authenticate using the _~/.netrc_ file you
created/updated.

`-c cookie_file` :: This tells _cURL_ to stash cookies in the file _cookie_file_

`-b cookie_file` :: This tells _cURL_ to read cookies from the file _cookie_file_

`-L` :: This option (aka _--location_) tells _cURL_ to follow redirects, which is a
must for any Single Sign On (SSO) authentication flow, such as OAuth2.

NOTE: Do not use the  ``--location-trusted`` option. It will cause
_cURL_ to spread user credentials to servers other than to which they were
associated.

`--url https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/ ...` :: The desired URL, protected by
the Earthdata Login authentication flow.

In order to retrieve multiple URLs without re-authenticating you can use
multiple instances of the _--url_ parameter:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
curl -k -n -c cookie_file -b cookie_file -L \
    --url https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/ \
    --url https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds \
    --url https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc.dds
----

Or, since _cURL_ is actually pretty smart about using cookies and such you can
also make multiple _curl_ requests with the same cookies, and it won't have to
reauthenticate with EDL once it's authenticated the first time:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
curl -k -n -c cookie_file -b cookie_file -L --url https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/
curl -k -n -c cookie_file -b cookie_file -L --url https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds
curl -k -n -c cookie_file -b cookie_file -L --url https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc.dds
----

=== _wget_

The _wget_ documentation indicates that _wget_ will automatically locate and
utilize the _.netrc_ file that we created for _curl_.

Summary ::
* Create a `~/.netrc` file as described in <<netrc,the .netrc section above>>
* Edit the `~/.netrc` file and associate your EDL credentials with the
EDL service endpoint.

And happily it appears to work, as long as the `~/.netrc` file is in place.

Consider this _wget_ command:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
wget  --load-cookies cookie_file --save-cookies cookie_file --keep-session-cookie https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds
----

What is happening here? :: In this request _wget_ is both authenticating and
maintaining a session with the remote server (the latter is accomplished by telling
wget to load and save cookies from the same file, _cookie_file_)

`--load-cookies cookie_file` :: Load cookies from the file "cookie_file"
`--save-cookies cookie_file` :: Save cookies to the file "cookie_file"
`--keep-session-cookie` :: Save session cookies.
`https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds` :: The URL to retrieve.

Here's the request:
[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
touch cookie_file # Make sure the cookie file exists
wget --load-cookies cookie_file --save-cookies cookie_file --keep-session-cookie  https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dds
----
Here's the output:
[source,sh]

It appears that _wget_ correctly followed the first redirect to
`urs.earthdata.nasa.gov`, where the EDL server responded with
"401 Unauthorized" (thanks to the app_type=401 query parameter in the
redirect URL provided by the _origin_ server). After getting the 401 _wget_
resubmits the request with the authentication credentials and the EDL server
accepts them and redirects _wget_ back to the _origin_ server to complete the
request.

[id=dodsrc]
=== _ncdump_, _nccopy_, _Matlab_, and other applications that use _NetCDF-C_
Applications built with one of UNIDATA's NetCDF libraries may require, in
addition to a _~/.netrc_ file, a _.dodsrc_ file to be present in the users home
directory in order for the application to successfully authenticate during
remote data access activities.
https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/dap2.html[You can learn more about
the _.dodsrc_ file at UNIDATA's NetCDF and DAP2 page.]

////
// There's different special file for DAP4
https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/dap4.html[The _~/.daprc_ file is the
UNIDATA's DAP4 version of the DAP2 _~/.dodsrc_ file.]
////

Summary ::
* Create a `~/.netrc` file as described in <<netrc,the .netrc section above>>
* Edit the `~/.netrc` file and associate your EDL credentials with the
EDL service endpoint.
* Next create (as needed) and then edit the file _~/.dodsrc_ so that it tells DAP
clients to use the _.netrc_ file for password information:

[source,apache]
----
HTTP.COOKIEJAR=/home/your_home_dir/cookie_file
HTTP.NETRC=/home/your_home_dir/.netrc

----

For other NeCDF-C built applications ::
__
Check the version of the netCDF C library that the application uses; once they
have updated to 4.3.3.1 or later, authentication configuration should be the
same as this `ncdump` example. That is, both EDL and LDAP-backed
HTTP/S-Basic authentication should work by reading credentials from the `.netrc`
file given that the `.dodsrc` file is set to point to them.
__

NOTE: This was tested with the `ncdump` and `nccopy` command line applications
that come bundled with the netcdf-c library. This content was developed using
NetCDF-4.9.0. Previous versions may not work.

NOTE: The online documentation for version
https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/4.8.1/index.html[netcdf-c-4.8.1] contains
instructions written by UNIDATA for
https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/4.8.1/md_auth.html[configuring authentication].
Oddly, the
https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/current/[online documentation most for
the current netcdf-c release, 4.9.2 at the time of this writing, no longer
contains an authentication/authorization discussion.]

=== https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/[_Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)]_

We http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/idv/current/index.jsp[downloaded the
latest version of IDV] (6.1u2 on 03/Apr/2023) and installed it on our local
system.

For EDL testing we utilized our AWS test service, configured to require EDL
authentication for all access of Hyrax.

In IDV we attempted to choose a new dataset by starting with the "*Data*" menu:
*Data* > *Choose Data* > *From A Web Server*

In the resulting pane we entered the AWS test service URL for our friend
_coads_climatology.nc_:

https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc

When we committed the edit (aka hit Enter) IDV popped up a dialog box that
indicated that the _urs.earthdata.nasa.gov_ server wanted our credentials:

(5.2.5 on 04/Apr/2023) and installed it on our local system. We launched Panoply
(clicking its icon in our Applications folder)

_Summary: Authentication FAILED_

For testing, we utilized our AWS test service, configured to require EDL
authentication for all access of Hyrax.

From the _File_ menu, we selected "Open Remote Dataset..." and in the pop dialog
we entered the URL for our friend _coads_climatology.nc_:

https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc

When we committed the edit (aka hit Enter) Panoply popped up a dialog box that
indicated that the _urs.earthdata.nasa.gov_ server wanted our credentials.

We entered them, clicked the save password check box, and clicked the _OK_
button.

Panoply returned a NUll Pointer exception

=== _PyDAP_
PyDAP includes an extension mechanism so that it can interact with
different kinds of authentication systems. This system is very flexible: we
were able to use it to add support for both LDAP and EDL using HTTP/S Basic
authentication.

Summary ::
* Create a `~/.netrc` file as described in <<netrc,the .netrc section above>>
* Edit the `~/.netrc` file and associate your EDL credentials with the
EDL service endpoint.

Once the _.netrc_ file is configured, start python, and then acquire data from
remote DAP services.
Here's a python script that  will open a PyDAP virtual connection to an
authenticated server if your `~/.netrc` is in order for EDL:

[source,python]
----
# PyDAP uses the request() function and automagically discovers the
# users credentials in ~/.netrc

import pydap

dataset_url="https://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/hyrax/data/nc/fnoc1.nc"

pydap_dataset = pydap.client.open_url(dataset_url, protocol="dap4")

// LDAP
//
== https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol[LDAP]
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) can do many things. One of
those things is to Single Sign On (SSO) authentication  service.

=== _cURL_ (a.k.a. _lib_curl_ or _curl_) ===

We were able to use command line _curl_ to retrieve LDAP authenticated resources
using the following technique.

Summary ::
* Create a `~/.netrc` file as described in <<netrc,the .netrc section above>>
* Edit the `~/.netrc` file and associate your credentials with the LDAP service
endpoint.

We could then access the top level directory of an LDAP authenticated
Hyrax server with the following _curl_ command:

[source,sh]
----
#!/bin/bash
curl -k -n -c cookie_file -b cookie_file  --url https://some.ldap.tester/opendap
----

What is happening here? :: In this request cURL is both authenticating and
maintaining a session with the remote server (this is accomplished by telling
cURL to load and save cookies from the same file, _cookie_file_ )


`-k` :: This tells _curl_ to accept self-signed certificates. This is ok for
working with trusted (as in your own) "test" services but should be removed
for working with production systems. Because: Security, Chain-Of-Trust, etc.
`-n` :: This tells _curl_ to use that _~/.netrc_ file we created.
`-c cookie_file` :: This tells _curl_ to stash cookies in the file _cookie_file_
`-b cookie_file` :: This tells _curl_ to read cookies from the file _cookie_file_
`--url https://130.56.244.153/opendap` :: The desired URL, protected LDAP
authentication.

NOTE: That the credentials are sent with every request so secure transport is a
must if user accounts are to be protected.

=== _ncdump_, _nccopy_, _Matlab_, _Ferret_, and other applications that are built on _NetCDF-C_
To configure `nccopy` and `ncdump` (and thus just about every client application
that uses netCDF C) for LDAP-back HTTP/S-Basic authentication, follow the same
exact procedure as outline above for EDL, except that in the _.netrc_ file, use
the OpenDAP server's machine name or IP number in place of the EDL
authentication site. Here's a summary, with an example:

Summary ::
* Create a `~/.netrc` file as described in <<netrc,the .netrc section above>>
* Edit the `~/.netrc` file and associate your credentials with the LDAP service
endpoint.
* Edit (create as needed) the _~/.dodsrc_ file so that it tells DAP clients to
use the _~/.netrc_ file for password information.

=== _Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)_ ===

For testing, we utilized an ANU/NCI puppet instance configured to require LDAP
authentication for all access of Hyrax.

In IDV we attempted to choose a new dataset by starting with the "Data" menu:
*Data* > *Choose Data* > *From A Web Server*

In the resulting pane we entered the LDAP test service URL for our friend
_coads_climatology.nc_:

https://130.56.244.153/hyrax/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc

When we committed the edit (aka hit Enter) IDV popped up a dialog box that
indicated that the _130.56.244.153_ server wanted our credentials:

=== _PyDAP_
PyDAP includes an extension mechanism so that it can interact with
different kinds of authentication systems. This system is very flexible: we
were able to use it to add support for both LDAP and EDL using HTTP/S Basic
authentication. The same scheme could be used to add support for Shibboleth,
although it would take additional development work (described in general below).

Summary ::
* Create a `~/.netrc` file as described in <<netrc,the .netrc section above>>
* Edit the `~/.netrc` file and associate your EDL credentials with the
EDL service endpoint.

Once the _.netrc_ file is configured, start python, and then acquire data from
remote DAP services.
Here's a python script that  will open a PyDAP virtual connection to an

// Shibboleth
//

== https://www.shibboleth.net[Shibboleth] ==
Shibboleth is a collection of open source tools that provide identity management
(aka authentication services) has fairly broad adoption globally. It is in use
at a number of UK and Australian institutions.

=== _cURL_ (a.k.a. _lib_curl_ or _curl_) ===

We were not able to use command line _curl_ to retrieve Shibboleth authentication
resources using the _.netrc_ technique described in the LDAP and EDL sections.

Analysis of the HTTP conversation between the idp.testshib.org  server and
_curl_ shows that curl correctly follows the series of 302 redirects issued to
it, first by the Apache service bound to the Hyrax server and then from the
idp.testshib.org server. In every request to the idp.testshib.org server the
_curl_ client correctly offers the credentials via the HTTP Authorization
header:

[source,apache]
----
0000: GET /idp/Authn/UserPassword HTTP/1.1
0026: Authorization: Basic bXlzZWxmOm15c2VsZg==
0051: User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.2

----

But the Shibboleth system doesn't respond to them. This may be a simple
configuration issue on the Shibboleth end, or it could be that the Shibboleth
protocol specifically forbids accepting credentials via HTTP Authorization
headers.

=== _ncdump_ and _nccopy_ ===

At the time of this writing the _ncdump_ application and the NetCDF library do
not support authentication using the Shibboleth ECP profile.

=== _Integrated Data Viewer (IDV)_ ===
_Summary: Failed To Authenticate_

For Shibboleth testing we utilized an AWS VM, configured to require Shibboleth
authentication for all access of Hyrax.

In IDV we attempted to choose a new dataset by starting with the "Data" menu:

In the resulting pane we entered the AWS VM service URL for our friend
_coads_climatology.nc_:

=== _Matlab, Ferret, Other applications that use NetCDF C_ ===
This is certain to not work until the netCDF C library is modified to explicitly
support it.

=== _PyDAP_
This will require a new patch function, similar to _install_basic_client()_ be
written. It will be a bit more complex because of the increased complexity of
Shibboleth, but the operation for end-users will likely be the same.
