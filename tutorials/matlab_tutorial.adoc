== Overview

.Who Is This Tutorial For?
This tutorial is for Matlab users who want to access OPeNDAP data services. In
the tutorial we will use Matlab's built-in OPeNDAP client to access data from
either a server we run just for this purpose or from a server NASA runs as part
of its effort to move data into a cloud computing environment.

This tutorial assumes that the reader has a basic grasp of Matlab commands and
programming. It also assumes that the reader has a basic grasp of the Matlab
netCDF interface.

The NASA data in this document will require that the user configure
their client applications to authenticate with the NASA Earthdata Login service.
Since the authentication setup is similar for many clients,
we have covered it in a separate document

* **link:https://opendap.github.io/documentation/tutorials/ClientAuthentication.html[Client Authentication Tutorial]**

.Tutorial Examples Language
The examples are written as Matlab commands. As much as possible, the examples
can be copied from the tutorial and run in the Matlab command window.

=== Matlab netCDF C details
The Matlab netCDF interface provides a way to read data from both netCDF files
on you computer and from remote OPeNDAP servers. The Matlab netCDF interface has two
parts: the netCDF C library and the Matlab interface to the netCDF C library. The latter,
the Matlab interface to the library is a set of Matlab functions that call the C library
and are documented in the Matlab help system. These functions are somewhat easier to use
that the netCDF library interface itself, but they are not as flexible as the C library.

In this tutorial we will use both the Matlab netCDF interface and the netCDF library calls.

==== Environment
You will need Matlab 2020a or later to run the examples in this tutorial.

=== The Data
In these examples will use GHRSST Level 3 Sea Surface Temperature data. The URL to
the data is given below and in the tutorial. In fact, there are two different URLs to the
same data. The first is a URL to a file on a server we run just for tutorial data and
testing while the second is a URL to a file on a NASA server running in NASA's Cloud
Computing Environment. Both of the URLs use the _dap4://_ URL prefix to indicate that
the netCDF software should use the DAP4 protocol to access the data. The URL to the
OPeNDAP test server can be used without authentication. To use the URL to the NASA
Cloud server, you will need to have an Earthdata Login (EDL) account and have configured
your client applications to
link:https://opendap.github.io/documentation/tutorials/ClientAuthentication.html[
authenticate with EDL].

GHRSST Sub-skin Sea Surface Temperature data, NASA Cloud, authentication required::
dap4://opendap.earthdata.nasa.gov/collections/C2036877806-POCLOUD/granules/20220812010000-OSISAF-L3C_GHRSST-SSTsubskin-GOES16-ssteqc_goes16_20220812_010000-v02.0-fv01.0

== Getting Started
First, start Matlab and make sure the dataset is accessible. If you encounter problems
at this step, try using the URL in a browser. You will need to replace the _dap4:://_
URL prefix with _http://_ to make the URL work in a browser.

When the `netcdf.open` function is called, the Matlab netCDF interface will attempt to
'open' the remote dataset. If that works, you will be about to use the `netcdf.inq` function
along with the netCDF ID returned by `netcdf.open` to get information about the dataset.
These function calls are examples of using the netCDF C library interface to get information.

We do that here and see that this dataset holds 19 variables.

[source,matlab]
----
>> ghrsst = 'dap4://test.opendap.org/opendap/hyrax/tutorials/20220812010000-OSISAF-L3C_GHRSST-SSTsubskin-GOES16-ssteqc_goes16_20220812_010000-v02.0-fv01.0.nc'
>> ncid = netcdf.open(ghrsst);
>> [numdims,numvars,numglobalatts,unlimdimid] = netcdf.inq(ncid);
>> numvars
numvars =

    19
----

The ncinfo() function can also be used to retrieve information about
the remote dataset. The `ncinfo()` function is a Matlab function that provides
a convenient way to access information about a remote dataset. It is a wrapper
to the netCDF library calls used in the previous example.

[source,matlab]
----
% Use the ncinfo function to retrieve information about the remote netCDF file
>> ncinfo_result = ncinfo(ghrsst);
----

In this case, the `ncinfo()` function retrieves information about the
remote netCDF file located at the specified URL and stores it in the
`ncinfo_result` structure. Information about the Dimensions, Variables,
and Global Attributes can all be accessed from the object returned by
`ncinfo()`. This same information can also be accessed using the ncid
returned by `netcdf.open()`, but `ncinfo()` packages the result conveniently.

----
ncinfo_result = 

  struct with fields:

      Filename: 'dap4://test.opendap.org/opendap/hyrax/tutorials/20220812010000-OSISAF-L3C_GHRSST-SSTsubskin-GOES16-ssteqc_goes16_20220812_010000-v02.0-fv01.0.nc'
          Name: '/'
    Dimensions: [1×3 struct]
     Variables: [1×19 struct]
    Attributes: []
        Groups: []
        Format: 'netcdf4'
     Datatypes: []
----

=== Getting more detailed information about the dataset
To see all the values of the fields of an attribute struct, you can
loop over the attributes and display their names and values using the
Matlab `disp()` function. Here's an example:

[source,matlab]
----
% Extract the global attributes from the ncinfo result
>> global_atts = ncinfo_result.Attributes;

% Loop over the attributes and display their names and values
>> disp('Global attributes:')
>> for i = 1:length(global_atts)
    att_name = global_atts(i).Name;
    att_val = global_atts(i).Value;
    disp([att_name, ': ', att_val])
end
----

In this case, we first extract the global attributes from the
Attributes field of the `ncinfo_result` structure. We then loop over the
attributes using a for loop, and for each attribute, we extract its
name and value using the Name and Value fields of the attribute
struct. We then display the attribute name and value using the disp
function. This will display all the global attributes and their
values.

We would like to look at the names of the variables in this dataset so
that we can use netcdf command to read the data values into Matlab.

To display the name, size, and dimensions of each variable in a
netCDF file, you can loop over the variables in the Variables field of
the ncinfo_result structure and display their names, sizes, and
dimensions using the `disp()` function. Here's an example:

[source,matlab]
----
% Loop over the variables and display their names and sizes
>> disp('Variables:')
>> for i = 1:length(ncinfo_result.Variables)
    var_name = ncinfo_result.Variables(i).Name;
    var_size = ncinfo_result.Variables(i).Size;
    var_dims = ncinfo_result.Variables(i).Dimensions;
    disp([var_name, ': ', mat2str(var_size), ' (', strjoin({var_dims.Name}, ', '), ')'])
end
----

We loop over the variables using a for loop, and for each variable, we
extract its name and size using the Name and Size fields of the
variable struct. We then display the variable name and size using the
`disp()` function. The `mat2str()` function is used to convert the variable
size from a numeric array to a string for display, and the `strjoin()`
function is used to concatenate the dimension names into a
comma-separated string. This will display the names, sizes, and
dimensions of all the variables in the netCDF file. This will display
the names and sizes of all the variables in the netCDF file.

=== Get a quick look at the data
We might want to get a quick look at the 'sea_surface_temperature'
array before going further, so let's do that. This will be far from
'publication ready,' but given that the array is quite large, it will
give us a look at the data.

[source,matlab]
----
>> sst_varid = netcdf.inqVarID(ncid, 'sea_surface_temperature');
>> sst_data = netcdf.getVar(ncid, sst_varid);
>> imagesc(sst_data);
>> colormap(hot);
----

This shows a plot in a popup window. It's pretty rough, but we can
manipulate the data later.

image::plot_1_a_quick_look.png[width=450]

== Using the data
To plot the data in a more publication-ready way, we will need to
get the vectors that hold the Latitude and Longitude coordinate information
for the Sea Surface Temperature data.

To read the data values for the 'lat' and 'lon' variables, we can
first ask for their variable IDs and then use those to read the
values.

[source,matlab]
----
>> % Get the IDs of the lat and lon variables
lat_varid = netcdf.inqVarID(ncid, 'lat');
lon_varid = netcdf.inqVarID(ncid, 'lon');

% Read the data for the lat and lon variables
lat_data = netcdf.getVar(ncid, lat_varid);
lon_data = netcdf.getVar(ncid, lon_varid);
----

=== Data wrangling
In many cases, data stored in files are not quite in teh form needed for actual use
in a toll like Matlab. Transforming the values so they are ready for analysis is
often called 'data wrangling'. We will need to do some data wrangling because the
data in `sst_data` are neither scaled nor are the missing data values replaced with _NaN_.

To find out how to transform the data, let's look at the attributes of the dataset
and see if there is any information there that will help us.

To get the attributes of a specific variable we can use the `ncinfo()`
function as follows:

[source,matlab]
----
% Get the variable's attributes
>> varinfo = ncinfo(ghrsst, 'sea_surface_temperature');
>> varinfo
----

The information returned is:

[listing]
----
varinfo = 

  struct with fields:

        Filename: 'dap4://test.opendap.org/opendap/hyrax/tutorials/20220812010000-OSISAF-L3C_GHRSST-SSTsubskin-GOES16-ssteqc_goes16_20220812_010000-v02.0-fv01.0.nc'
            Name: 'sea_surface_temperature'
      Dimensions: [1×3 struct]
            Size: [2400 2400 1]
        Datatype: 'int16'
      Attributes: [1×12 struct]
       ChunkSize: []
       FillValue: 'disable'
    DeflateLevel: []
         Shuffle: 0
          Format: 'netcdf4'
----

As before with the dataset's global attributes, loop over the
attributes and display their names and values. This version of the loop
is slightly more complex because some attributes are strings and
some are numeric. The `ischar()` function is used along with `fprintf()`
to display the values correctly (note that in the format string used with
`fprintf()`, the %g format specifier is used to display numeric values, e.g.).

[source,matlab]
----
>> disp('sea_surface_temperature attributes:')
>> for i = 1:length(varinfo.Attributes)
    attr = varinfo.Attributes(i);
    name = attr.Name;
    value = attr.Value;
    
    if ischar(value)
        fprintf('%s = ''%s''\n', name, value);
    else
        fprintf('%s = %g\n', name, value);
    end
end
----

The output shows the numerical values correctly:

[listing]
----
_FillValue = -32768
long_name = NaN
standard_name = NaN
units = NaN
add_offset = 273.15
scale_factor = 0.01
valid_min = -300
valid_max = 4500
depth = NaN
source = NaN
comment = NaN
_edu.ucar.maps = NaN
/lat = NaN
----

The variable attributes __FillValue_, _add_offset_, and _scale_factor_ indicate
how the values will need to be modified to get the correct values.

[source,matlab]
----
% Get the scale factor and add offset
scale_factor = varinfo.Attributes(strcmp({varinfo.Attributes.Name},'scale_factor')).Value;
add_offset = varinfo.Attributes(strcmp({varinfo.Attributes.Name},'add_offset')).Value;

% Get the fill value
fill_value =
varinfo.Attributes(strcmp({varinfo.Attributes.Name},'_FillValue')).Value
----

Before we go further, lets look at those values:

[source,matlab]
----
scale_factor =

    0.0100

>> add_offset

add_offset =

  273.1500

>> fill_value

fill_value =

  int16

   -32768
   
>> sst_data(1:150:2400, 1:150:2400)

ans =

  16×16 int16 matrix

...

----

The `sst_data` array in an Int16 array, but we would like an array of
double values. Once we have that, we can replace the fill_value cells
with NaN and scale the data.

[source,matlab]
----
% Convert to double
>> data = double(sst_data);

% Set fill values to NaN
>> fv_mask = data == fill_value;
>> data(fv_mask) = NaN;

% Look at a sub-sample of the values
>> data(1:150:2400, 1:150:2400)

ans =

  16×16 double matrix

...

>> data = data * scale_factor + add_offset;
>> data(1:150:2400, 1:150:2400)

ans =

       NaN       NaN       NaN       NaN       NaN       NaN       NaN
       299.2100  297.1900       NaN       NaN  296.9300       NaN
       NaN       NaN       NaN

       NaN       NaN       NaN       NaN       NaN       NaN
       NaN  299.4000  297.0700       NaN       NaN       NaN  294.8500
       NaN       NaN       NaN

----

=== Plotting

The data values are rotated 90 degrees (because netCDF uses C notion
of row-major order but Matlab uses column-major order).

[source,matlab]
----
% Use the apostrophe (') operator to transpose the data
>> data_t = data';
----
The data store negative latitude at the top and positive at the
bottom - we need those flipped for a north-up plot.

[source,matlab]
----
>> imagesc(lon_mesh(1,:), flip(lat_mesh(:,1)), data_t);
----

However, that leaves the Y-axis labels still inverted; use this 'set'
command to flip tha Y-axis labels.

[source,matlab]
----
>> set(gca,'YTickLabel',flip(get(gca,'YTickLabel')));
% Add x and y axis labels
>> xlabel('Longitude');
>> ylabel('Latitude');
----

Set the range of the color bar and the colormap

[source,matlab]
----
>> caxis([270, 310]);

% Try out various color maps
>> colormap(hot);
>> colormap(cool);
>> colormap(parula);
>> colorbar;
----

Here's the plot. It lacks a coastline because we want to show access without
requiring any of the optional Matlab packages that provide coastlines. However,
the North and South American continents are clearly visible. It _is_
possible to download the coastlines and plot them, but that is beyond the scope
of this tutorial.
