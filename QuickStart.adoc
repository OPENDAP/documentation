== Introduction ==

http://www.opendap.org/[OPeNDAP] is the developer of client/server
software, of the same name, that enables scientists to share data more
easily over the internet. The OPeNDAP group is also the original
developer of the https://zenodo.org/records/10794666[Data
Access Protocol 2.0] (DAP2), and the much modern https://opendap.github.io/dap4-specification/DAP4.html[Data Access Protocol 4] (DAP4) that the software uses. Many other groups have
adopted DAP and provide compatible clients, servers, and SDKs.
OPeNDAP's DAP is also a NASA community standard. For the rest of this
document, "OPeNDAP" will refer to the software.

With OPeNDAP, you can access data using an OPeNDAP URL of any database
server that supports OPeNDAP. You can do this via command-line,
Internet browser, or a custom UI. You can also use other NetCDF compliant tools, 
such as PyDAP/Python, Matlab, R, IDL, IDV, and Panoply.

NOTE: OPeNDAP data is, by
default, stored and transmitted in binary form. In addition to its
native data representation format, OPeNDAP can get data in the
following formats: NetCDF3 (classic), NetCDF4 (enhanced), GeoTIFF, JPEG2000, JSON, ASCII.

// DONE: jhrg Ways that OPeNDAP supports getting data: NetCDF, GeoTIFF, JPEG2000, JSON, ASCII

This quick start guide covers how to use OPeNDAP in a typical web
browser, such as Firefox, Chrome, or Safari, to discover information
about data that is useful when creating database queries. For
additional information, see the OPeNDAP User Guide.

// DONE: jhrg TODO Add information about the other clients/examples (Matlab, ...)

// jhrg TODO In this text you're using 'database' in a way that's technically correct, but which may be confusing to users who will think more of servers and datasets. I'll have to think about just how important that distinction is...

=== Key Terms ===

* *Hyrax:* The server half of OPeNDAP, developed by the OPeNDAP group.
* *OPeNDAP URL* An OPeNDAP URL is a URL that includes "opendap.org" and 
   enables you to access data on a database server on which OPeNDAP is implemented.
* *DAP (Data Access Protocol):* A data transmission protocol designed
   by OPeNDAP specifically for sciencific data. The protocol relies on
   the widely used and stable HTTP and MIME standards and provides
   data types to accommodate gridded data, relational data, and time
   series, as well as allowing users to define their own data types.
* *Constraint Expressions (CEs):* Criteria that limits/subsets what data is returned
   from a remote database. Because most databases will have far more data
   than you want, you'll want to find out something out about the data
   and then use that information to constrain your queries. Any subsetting as a result
   to _CEs_ takes place close to the data.
* *DMR (Dataset Metadata Response):* This is single XML file used in the DAP4 protocol, 
   that provides information about the data file such as: variable names, their types, sizes, 
   dimensions, and many other attributes. A client that parses the DMR
   can create remote Dataset objects that accurately describe the data file, 
   without openning nor downloding any remote data (lazy reads).
* *DDS (Dataset Descriptor Structure):* Provides a description in the DAP2 
   protocol of the "shape" of data in a database, using a vaguely C-like syntax.
* *DAS (Data Attribute Structure):* Similar to a DDS but contains
   information about the data, such as units and the name of the
   variable. Used only in the DAP2 protocol.

// DONE: jhrg No: An OPeNDAP URL will include "opendap.org" in its path.

== Which DAP Protocol should I use to access/serve data?

[[dap2dap4]]
.Differences in the data model and response types between DAP2 and DAP4. 
image::DAP4vsDAP2.png[width=750, align='center']


There are many differences between the DAP2 and DAP4 protocol, and we refer to the 
https://opendap.github.io/dap4-specification/DAP4.html[DAP4 specification] for an in-depth
look at what these are. Broadly speaking, the DAP4 data model is close to a _superset_ of
DAP2, meaning any data file that can be transmitted via the DAP2 (DODS) protocol, _CAN
BE_ transmitted via the DAP4 protocol. And despite the fact that `Grids` are no longer part 
of DAP4 (see xref:dap2dap4[Figure 1]), any _Array_ represented in the DAP2 data model
as a _Grid_ _IS_ represented as an _Array_ in the DAP4 data model. However, any DAP4 dataset 
that contains atomic types (e.g. an _attribute_ or a _variable_) or container types that are 
_NOT_ part of the  DAP2 data model (i.e. a _Group_), will _NOT_ be able to be represented by the DAP2 model and the transmition via DAP2 protocol will fail.



NOTE: It is possible that DAP2 protocol will transmit datasets with _missing attributes_, 
when these _attributes_ have atomic types beyond the scope of the DAP2 data model (e.g. `Char`, 
`Int64`, etc; see xref:dap2dap4[Figure 1]).


We strongly recommend users to adopt the DAP4 Protocol. Any Hyrax data server that implements the DAP4
protocol _CAN_ produce _DAP2_ responses. This means that any existing data user with an access client API that is only compatible with the DAP2 protocol (DDS/DAS), will still be able to access data from a DAP4 implementing Hyrax data server, as long as the data file contains _types_ within the scope of the DAP2 data model.


== What to do With an OPeNDAP URL ==

Suppose someone gives you a hot tip that there is a lot of good data at...
----------------------------------------------------
http://test.opendap.org:8080/opendap/atlas03/ATL03_20181228015957_13810110_003_01.h5
----------------------------------------------------

This URL points to Level 2 data from the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter (ATLAS) instrument above the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). This particular file from the ATLAS03 was created by NASA in 2021, and has over 80 Groups with many variables inside.

The simplest thing you can is to download the data to which the URL points or you could append **.ascii** and feed the URL to a regular web browser. However, the file may contain data that is too big
to perform simple exploratory analysis using any of the two mentioned approaches. 

Another option is to use a Client API of your preference, that can _parse_ the DMR response. Packages and applications like https://pydap.github.io/pydap/intro.html[PyDAP], https://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/[Ferret], and MATLAB, have long included support for parsing DAP responses. But this approach works best when the remote dataset has few variables, i.e. less than 5, and when the DMR is relatively small. Many datasets produced by NASA, NOAA, can have 100s of variables, with many nested _Groups_, which all make parsing of the DAP response slower, and it also _takes long time for the Client API to parse the 
DMR_. Just opening such files (lazily) can be huge bottleneck for many users, even more when attempting to read multiple files in parallel, each file with 100s of variables.


Instead, OPeNDAP has long supported METADATA inspection of remote datasets via 
link:https://www.opendap.org/support/online-help-files/[Data Request Forms].

NOTE: Because you will rarely want to request an entire archive,
OPeNDAP provides sophisticated sub-sampling capabilities, and you need
to know something about the data in order to use them.

=== An Easy Way: Using the Browser-Based OPeNDAP Server Dataset Request Form ===

OPeNDAP includes a way to sample data that makes writing a constraint
expression somewhat easier than using only a URL to do the same thing.
Append *.dmr.html* to an OPeNDAP URL, and you will get an OPeNDAP Server
DAP4 Dataset Request Form that simplifies the process for sampling data.

[[DAPRequestForm]]
.DAP4 Data Request form for the dataset (to see the Request Form, click link:http://test.opendap.org:8080/opendap/atlas03/ATL03_20181228015957_13810110_003_01.h5.dmr.html[here]) 
image::DRF_ATLAS03.png[align="center"]

The OPeNDAP Server DAP4 Dataset Request Form has four main sections. To learn more about the
basic Data Request form go to link:https://www.opendap.org/support/online-help-files/[OPeNDAP Website Resource].


The DAP4 Request Form allows one to inspect the entire dataset, all variables, its medatada, 
their size, and importantly it can allow users to **subset the dataset close to the data**.
OPeNDAP servers are specialized in subsetting close to the data, and the subsetting can be done 
in two different ways:

1. Reduce the number of variables (less variables)
2. Reduce the size of variables (spatial subset)

Together, these can greatly speed up the response and significantly reduce the amount of time
 a Client API spends parsing the _DMR_ to represent the dataset for exploration.


The DAP4 Request Form has an interactive feature to build a new URL that represents the 
subset dataset. For example, consider that you are only interested in plotting one of the track 
as a function of time. Say Data within the Group `gt3r`, and within it the time, longitude and
latitude within the `heights` subgroup. You check the boxes related the three variables
of interest, with their following link:https://opendap.github.io/dap4-specification/DAP4.html#_fully_qualified_names[Fully Qualifying Names]:

```
/gt3r/heights/delta_time
/gt3r/heights/lat_ph
/gt3r/heights/lon_ph
```


And the resulting URL on the DataURL box becomes:

```
dataURL + ?dap4.ce=/gt3r/heights/delta_time[0:1:4548381];/gt3r/heights/lat_ph[0:1:4548381];/gt3r/heights/lon_ph[0:1:4548381]
```
NOTE: the `+` in the URL above implies concatenation of the two strings. One can also ommit the hyperslabs in the Constraint Expression: `?dap4.ce=/gt3r/heights/delta_time;/gt3r/heights/lat_ph;/gt3r/heights/lon_ph`. The semi-colon `;` is used to separate variable names. The two options are identicals. The hyperslab allows for spatial subsetting, but the square brackets NEED to be ESCAPED by Client APIs. PyDAP, for example, does that.

The URL above is the original URL plus a Constraint Expression (*CE*). You can pass that URL
to a client API (like PyDAP) and it will request from Hyrax the (much reduced) _DMR_ associated only
with these three variables.


The OPeNDAP Server Dataset Request Form works for sequence data as well
as grids. However, since sequence constraint expressions look
different from grid expressions, the form also looks slightly
different. The variable selection boxes allow you to enter relational
expressions for each variable. Apart from that, the function is
exactly the same.

[[Gsodock]]
.Data Request Form for a Sequence (click http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/ff/gsodock.dat.html[here] to see a live "sequence" form)
image::Gsodock-html.png[align="center"]

Click the checkboxes to choose which data types you want returned, and then add constraint expressions as desired. The data file contains a day's record of changing water properties off
a dock in Rhode Island. If you click the _Depth_ and _Time_ boxes (as in
the xref:Gsodock[figure 3]), you will get a record of the tide going in and out twice. You
can add conditions by entering values in the text boxes. See what you
get when you limit the selection to records where the Depth is greater
than 2 meters.

=== A More Flexible Way: Using Commands in a Browser ===

If you would prefer to not use the OPeNDAP Server Data Access Form,
you can use just a browser instead. This section describes how to do
that.

OPeNDAP has sophisticated methods for subsampling data at a remote
site, but you need some information about the data first. First, we
will look at data's DMR. This provides a description of the "shape" of the data, 
types, and attributes. You get a dataset's _DMR_ by appending *.dmr.xml* to the URL, 
which is an _xml_ document. 

NOTE: The _xml_ is a interactive document that allows to click and collapse the information on the _DMR_. xref:Reynolds_dmr[Figure 4] has all the _nodes_ associated with _Attributes_ collapsed. 

For example, consider the much simpler http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.dmr[Reynolds Dataset] from NOAA, describing mean sea surface temperature. Click
http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.dmr.xml[here] to see
an example of an OPeNDAP DMR for the REYNOLDS Dataset
at `sst.mnmean.nc.gz.dmr.xml`. The (collapsed) _DMR_ looks like this:

[[Reynolds_dmr]]
.XML browser view the _DMR_ of the Reynolds Dataset.
image::Reynolds_dmr.png[align="center"]


From the sst.mnmean.nc.gz DMR in xref:Reynolds_dmr[Figure 4], you can see that the dataset consists of:


* Dataset declaration.
* Dimensions declaration by their name and size
* Numeric types of the _Array_ data with appropriate _Dimension_ and _Attribute_ declarations in their nodes (not visible on xref:Reynolds_dmr[Figure 4]).
* Global Attributes declaration.


The _DMR_ in xref:Reynolds_dmr[Figure 4] broadly allows another interactive inspection
of a remote dataset.


Note that the same dataset can be represented by the same DAP4 server as a Grid by adding
a `.dds` at the end of the URL

[[Reynolds_dds]]
.DDS representing a Grid Array not part of the DAP4 protocol, by a DAP4 enabled server.
image::Reynolds_dds.png[]


Continuing with the DMR, we can inspect the response to a URL with a Constraint Expression. 
This allows us to quickly verify that the resulting _DMR_ represents only the data we 
are interesed. For example, say we are only interested in sea surface temperature (`sst`).
The URL with the constraint expression, along with the added `.dmr.xml` is:

```
http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.dmr.xml?dap4.ce=/sst
```

This URL on a browser results in the DMR shown in xref:Reynolds_dmr_sst[Figure 6].

[[Reynolds_dmr_sst]]
.DMR showing only the variable `sst` and the attributes of the dataset.
image::Reynolds_dmr_sst.png[align='center']

A savvy User can now use the client API along with the above Constrained URL, to speed up their
exploration and analysis.


Lastly, going back to the original ATLAS03 dataset with over 80 Groups, and many more variables
referenced in xref:DAPRequestForm[Figure 2], the CE to discard all variables except `delta_time`, `lon_ph` and `lat_ph` from the response, yields the following (_XML_) _DMR_

[[Atlas03_dmr_constrained]]
.DMR showing 3 variables inside the nested Group hierarcy `/gt3r/heights/` (in this case we use the `firefox` browser which allows a more collapsable view of the DMR than `Google Chrome`)
image::ATLAS03_ConstrainedDMR.png[]


A Client API such as  will parse much faster such response, as compared to the original dataset.

[[Peeking_at_Data]]
==== Peeking at Data ====

Now that we know a little about the shape of the data and the data
attributes, we will look at some of the data.

// DONE: jhrg TODO There should be a better way to write the [] in the URLs. People will think they have to use the hex escapes.

You can request a piece of an array with subscripts, just like in a C
program, Matlab, or many other computer languages. Use a colon to
indicate a subscript range. For example,
http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?time%5b0:6%5d[http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?time[0:6\]]
will produce a time vector that looks like this:

.Peak at the Reynolds data on the browser, only a subset of the `time` variable is requested by the CE.
image::Reynolds_time_vector.png[]

If you are interested in the Reynolds dataset, you are probably more
interested in the sea surface temperature data than the dependent
variable vectors. The temperature data is a three-dimensional grid. To
sample the sst grid, you just add a dimension for time:
"...sst/mnmean.nc.ascii?sst[0:1][13:16][103:105]". Click
http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?sst%5b0:1%5d%5b13:16%5d%5b103:105%5d[here]
to see this example in action. You will see something like this:

.Peak at the Reynolds data on the browser, a subset of the `sst` variable is requested by the CE.
image::Reynolds_sst.png[]

Notice that when you ask for part of an OPeNDAP grid, you get the array
part along with the corresponding parts of the map vectors.

One potentially confusing thing about our request is that we requested
the time, latitude, and longitude by their position in the map vectors,
but in the returned information they are referenced by their values.
That is, we asked for the 0th and 1st time values, but these are 19723
and 19754. We also asked for the 103rd, 104th, and 105th longitude
values, but these are 206, 208, and 210 degrees, respectively. The value
434 in the return can be referenced as "...sst/mnmean.nc.ascii?sst[1][15][103]". Click http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?sst%5b1%5d%5b15%5d%5b103%5d[here] to see this in action.

Note that the sst values are in Celsius degrees multiplied by 100, as
indicated by the *scale_factor* attribute of the
http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.das[DAS]. Further,
it's important to remember that with this dataset the data were
obtained by calculating spatial and temporal means. Consequently, the
data points in the *sst* array should be ignored when the value is the
missing data flag (32767) as these pixels are probably coincident with
land (although there can be other reasons for missing data).

===== Server Functions: Looking at Geo-Referenced Data Using Hyrax =====

There are a number of different DAP servers that have been developed by
different organizations. Hyrax, the DAP server developed by the OPeNDAP
group, supports access to geo-referenced data using lat/lon coordinates.
You probably noticed that the array and grid indexes used so far are not
very intuitive. You can see the data are global and are indexed by
latitude and longitude, but in the previous example we first looked at
the lat and lon vectors, saw which indexes corresponded to which
real-world locations, and then made our accesses using those indexes.

Hyrax supports a small set of functions which can perform these
look-up operations for you. For example, we could rewrite the example
above like this:
"...sst/mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?geogrid(sst,62,206,56,210,"19722<time<19755")".
Click
http://test.opendap.org/opendap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?geogrid(sst,62,206,56,210,%2219722%3Ctime%3C19755%22)[here]
to see this in action. The results look like this:

.Same as Figure 9, but in this case the CE used `geogrid()`.
image::Reynolds_sst_geogrid.png[]

The Syntax for `geogrid()` is: "geogrid(grid variable, upper latitude, left longitude, lower latitude,
right longitude, _other expressions_)", where _other expressions_ must be enclosed in double quotes, and can be one of these forms:

* variable relop value
* value relop variable
* value relop variable relop value

*Relop* stands for one of the relational operators: <,>,<=,>=,=,!=.
*Value* stands for a numeric constant, and *Variable* must be the name
of one of the grid dimensions. You can use multiple clauses by
separating them with commas, but each clause must be surrounded by
double quotes. For example, the following is yet another way to get the
same return data as the above example: 

http://test.opendap.org/opendap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?geogrid(sst,62,206,56,210,%2219722%3Ctime%22,%22time%3C19755%22)[...mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?geogrid(sst,62,206,56,210,"19722<time","time<19755")]

You can figure out which functions are supported by Hyrax by calling
the server function
http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?version()[version()].
This will return an XML document that shows each registered function and
its version.

To find out how to call each function, you can call it with an empty
parameter list and get some documentation for that function. For
example, try
http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?geogrid()[...?geogrid()].

// DONE: jhrg TODO Add a note that other servers may support other ways of doing an equivalent operation (e.g., ERDDAP does, TDS does not AFAIK). We don't really want to rank on TDS, however, so maybe soft-pedal that...

NOTE: Other severs, such as ERDAP, support alternative ways of doing similar operations.

===== Creating Server Function Pipelines =====

Server functions can be composed to form pipelines, feeding the value of
one function to another. Since the values in this data set are scaled up
by a factor of 100, we can use the _linear_scale()_ function to scale
the result using...

----------
y = mx + b
----------

...where *m* is the scale factor and *b* offset. The _linear_scale()_
function syntax is:

* linear_scale(variable, scale factor, offset)

* linear_scale(variable)

Use the first form when you want to specify *m* and *b* explicitly or
the second form when Hyrax can guess the values using data set metadata.
(Note: You will get an error if the server cannot figure out value to use). For example, 

http://test.opendap.org/opendap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.ascii?linear_scale(geogrid(sst,78,0,56,10,%22time=19723%22),0.01,0)[...nc.gz.ascii?linear_scale(geogrid(sst,78,0,56,10,"time=19723"),0.01,0)] produces the following:

.Same as Figure 9, now the CE makes use of `geogrid()` and use `linear_scale` as `Server Side Functions`.
image::Reynolds_sst_linear_scale_geogrid.png[]

==== Working With Sequence Data ====

Gridded data works well for satellite images, model data, and data
compilations such as the Reynolds data we have just looked at. Other data,
such as data measured at a specific site, are not so readily stored in
that form. OPeNDAP provides a data type called a "sequence" to store this
kind of data.

A sequence can be thought of as a relational data table, with each
column representing a different data variable, and each row representing
a different measurement of a set of values (also called an "instance").
For example, an ocean temperature profile can be stored as a Sequence
with two columns: pressure and temperature. Each measurement is a
pressure and a temperature and is contained in one row. A weather
station's data can be stored as a sequence with time in one column and
each weather variable in another column. You can find a good example of a sequence at http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/ff/gsodock.dat.info[http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/ff/gsodock.dat]

This is a 24-hour record of measurements at a weather station on a dock
in Rhode Island. Each record consists of a dozen different variables,
including air temperature, wind speed, and direction, as well as depth,
temperature, and water salinity The data is arranged into 144
measurements of each of the twelve variables.

http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/ff/gsodock.dat.dds[Ask for the DDS], and you will see the twelve variables, all contained in a Sequence called URI_GSO-Dock:

.DDS for the entire sequence (DAP2 response)
image::Gsodock-dds.png[]

http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/ff/gsodock.dat.das[The DAS] contains the units for each data type and some additional information:

.FAS for the entire Sequence (DAP2 response)
image::Gsodock-das.png[]

To select the data you want from a server, use a constraint
expression, just as you did with the gridded data above. Now, though,
the constraint contains two kinds of clauses. One is a list of
variables you wish to have returned (the *projection* clause), 
and the other is the conditions under which they should be returned
(the *selection* clause). For example, if you want to see salinity 
data read after noon that day, try this:

http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/ff/gsodock.dat.ascii?URI_GSO-Dock.Salinity&URI_GSO-Dock.Time%3E35234.5[...gsodock.dat.ascii?URI_GSO-Dock.Salinity&URI_GSO-Dock.Time>35234.5]

Selection clauses can be stacked endlessly against a projection clause,
allowing all the flexibility most people need to sample data files.
Here is an example of applying two conditions:

http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/ff/gsodock.dat.ascii?URI_GSO-Dock.Salinity&URI_GSO-Dock.Time%3E35234.5&URI_GSO-Dock.Depth%3E2[...gsodock.dat.ascii?URI_GSO-Dock.Salinity&URI_GSO-Dock.Time>35234.5&URI_GSO-Dock.Depth>2]

Try it yourself with three or four conditions or more.

== Finding OPeNDAP URLs ==

Data often comes in the form of a URL enclosed in an email message,
and there are several other ways to find data served by OPeNDAP
servers.

// DONE: jhrg TODO Google works too. Use Google to search for 'OPeNDAP Hyrax' or to search for 'OPeNDAP <terms>' or 'Hyrax <terms>'

=== Google ===

Use Google to search for 'OPeNDAP Hyrax' or to search for 'OPeNDAP <terms>' or 'Hyrax <terms>'. For example, Google _OPeNDAP sea surface temperature_.

=== GCMD ===

The https://gcmd.earthdata.nasa.gov/[Global Change Master Directory] provides
a huge amount of earth science data and catalogs OPeNDAP URLs for the
datasets that have them. You can search on "OPeNDAP" from the main
page to find many of these datasets.

If you make that search, check the list for the Reynolds data; it should be there.

=== Web Interface ===

Many sites that serve one OPeNDAP dataset also serve others. The
OPeNDAP web interface (if it is enabled by the site) allows you to
check the directory structure for other datasets. For example, we will
look at the Reynolds data we saw previously:
http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/sst.mnmean.nc.gz.html

If we use the same URL, but without the file name at the end, we can
browse the directory of data: http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/

The OPeNDAP server checks to see whether the URL is a directory, and if
it is, it generates a directory listing, like http://test.opendap.org/dap/data/nc/[this:]

image::Test.oopendap.org_directory_view.png[]

You can see from the directory listing that the monthly mean dataset
that we have been looking at is accompanied by a host of other datasets. The
site you are looking at is our test data sit. We use these datasets to
run many of our nightly tests. All of the files in the the _/data/nc_
directory are stored in NetCDF files; other directories under _/data_
hold data stored in other file types.

NOTE: In general, this list is produced by an OPeNDAP server and
this feature works on all servers. However, it only really understands
OPeNDAP data files, so other file types will simply be sent without
any interpretation. This can be useful if the 'other file' happens to
be a README or other documentation file since this makes it simple to
serve data stored in files and documented using plain text files.
Essentially, the person or organization providing data does not need
to do anything besides link:https://opendap.github.io/hyrax_guide/Master_Hyrax_Guide.html[installing the server (Hyrax)].

// jhrg TODO I think there are no more file servers running. Lets add a section on 
// Using Google to find servers. I'll comment this section out.
//=== File Servers ===
//
//Some datasets that you will find are actually lists of other datasets. These
//are called _file servers_ and are themselves OPeNDAP datasets, organized
// as a Sequence, containing URLs with some other identifying data (often
// time). You can request the entire dataset or subsample it just like any
// other OPeNDAP dataset.

// NASA's atmospheric composition data information services maintains some
// OPeNDAP file servers:

// http://acdisc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/opendap/catalog/DatapoolCatalog/AIRS/contents.html

// Try selecting one of the datasets listed in the above, and look at the
// DDS and DAS of that dataset. You will see it is a list of OPeNDAP URLs

This guide is about forming an OPeNDAP URL. After you have figured out
how to request the data, there are a variety of things you can do with
it. (OPeNDAP software mentioned here is available from the
http://www.opendap.org[OPeNDAP Home Page].)

// DONE: jhrg TODO Add a reference to the User's Guide and include that there
// are examples of Matlab, ..., there

* Use a generic web client like *geturl* (a standard part of the
OPeNDAP software) or free programs such as
https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/[wget], https://curl.haxx.se/[curl]
or *Chrome* to download data into a local data file. To be able to use
the data further, you will probably want to download the data using
one of alternative response types like the ASCII version (by using the
*.ascii* suffix on the URL, as in the examples shown above) or
GeoTIFF, NetCDF3, Jpeg2000, etc., using the suffix appropriate for
those formats.
//jhrg TODO I hacked your text above.

* Any tool that uses the Java- or C-NetCDF API will work with OPeNDAP.
For example, Matlab has built-in support for OPeNDAP; Matlab supported
NetCDF calls can be used with DAP datasets. Other tools that are built
on NetCDF API also read data from OPeNDAP servers. A free tool similar
to Matlab, https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/[GNU Octave], is also
supported. The https://www.r-project.org/[R Project] for Statistical
Computing can also read data from OPeNDAP servers. The
https://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/[Ferret] and
http://cola.gmu.edu/grads/[GrADS] free data analysis packages both
support OPeNDAP. You can use these for down loading OPeNDAP data and
for examining it afterwards. (There are limitations. For example,
Ferret may not be able to read datasets served as Sequence data.)

NOTE: For information about NetCDF compliant tools, see the NetCDF Compliant Tools in the link:{user-guide-doc}#NetCDFTools[User Guide].

* Other tools, that are Java NetCDF compliant, also function with
  OPeNDAP clients; for example,
  http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/[IDV] and
  http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/[Panoply].

* If you have written a C NetCDF or Java NetCDF compliant data
  analysis program, you can probably read data from OPeNDAP servers.

The use of these clients, like the ways in which you can analyze the
data you find, is beyond the scope of this document.
