== Introduction
This document describes the Back End Server (BES) that is used by Hyrax to
read data, build response, perform data subsetting operations and run small
compute tasks that are proximate to data. The BES makes up the lower two tiers
of the Hyrax data server.

The BES software was initially designed and written at the High Altitude Observatory
(HAO) of the University Corporation for Atmosphere Research (UCAR) in the early
2000s by Jose Garcia, Patrick West, and Peter Fox.

.The Hyrax Data Server Architecture
[#img-hyrax-arch]
image::Hyrax-Architecture.svg["Hyrax Architecture"]

The BES Framework and modules shown in <<img-hyrax-arch>> are the subject of this
document. The _Module_ components of the BES are where the data- and response-specific
behavior of the BES are encoded. The _Framework_ is the orchestration engine of the
BES. It interprets a command from the OLFS, plans how to build the requested response
from the named data and how data are passed from one module to another.

In a broad sense, there are two kinds of modules: those that read from a data source
(called a _BESContainer_) and those that build responses. The BES natively supports
the OPeNDAP _DAP2_ and _DAP4_ data protocols as well as an extensible set of file
formats that includes NetCDF3 and 4, JPEG2000, GeoTiff, ASCII/CSV and XML. Modules
can not only read from files on a POSIX file system, but they can read from SQL databases,
S3 and similar Web Object Stores (WOS) and other kinds of remote servers.

== BES Modules and Component Assembly
A module is an instance of BESAbstractModule is linked as a run-time loadable module. For example,
<<#img-nc-module>> shows how the `NCModule` class inherits from the BESAbstractModule class. The
NCModule is the base of the module that reads data from the netCDF3 and 4 files,
see <<src-nc-module>>.

.The NCModule Class
[#img-nc-module]
image::classNCModule__coll__graph.png[NCModule collaboration diagram]

The code in the implementation of, e.g., NCModule is used by the BES daemon to initialize
the model at startup. Each specialization of BESAbstractModule should define `initialize()`
and `terminate()`. The initialize() method is used when the module is first loaded. It performs
all the startup actions the module needs. In <<src-nc-module>> the initialize() method makes
some objects and passes those to methods that will add them to BES List (see Section
<<sec-bes-lists>>) classes. The classes
and the Lists are not important right now - just know that when a module is loaded, the
initialize() method is run.

When the daemon shuts down, each Module is 'unloaded' and its terminate() method is run. That is
not shown in the listing, but you can find it in the GitHub repo _OPENDAP/bes_ or in the
https://opendap.github.io/bes/html/classes.html[online reference documentation].

=== How Modules are Loaded
In the BES daemon, a _master listener_ is started, the configuration files are read, the BES Keys
(our name for the configuration parameters) are parsed, and all of the modules are loaded.
The details of the server startup operations are discussed in Section <<sec-startup>>, BES Startup.

One detail you will need to know, common to all modules, is that an extern C function named `maker()`
must be included. This function is used when the module is loaded to make an instance of the Module
class. Once the instance is made, a pointer to the module is stored in an instance of BESModuleApp.
The BESModuleApp also contains the `loadModules()` method that runs each module's initialize()
method.

=== What You Need to Know About Modules
The process of loading and unloading modules is interesting, but it is performed by parts of the
BES framework that are rarely modified. You need to know that the initialize() and terminate()
methods and the maker() _virtual constructor_ must be included in a Module implementation.

In addition to the code of the module, the correct entries in the BES Keys must be made. To be
loaded, a module must have two BES keys set correctly. The first is that the name of the module
must be included in the comma separated list of names set to the `BES.modules` key. The module
can have any name (assuming valid syntax) so long as it is not already in use. There is one
Key called BES.Modules for the entire BES. See <<src-mod-keys>>.

The second BES Key is formed using the module name as a suffix to `BES.module`. The value of
this key is full path to the shared object file that holds the module software and that will
be loaded by the BESModuleApp using the unix/Linux `dload()` system call.

In the example <<src-mod-keys>>, the module name is `nc` so the BES Key that holds the path
of the shared object files is `BES.module.nc`. The one key that lists all the modules is
`BES.modules` (plural) while the key that unique
for each module is `BES.module.<mod name>` (singular).

[NOTE]
In the <<src-nc-module>> example, the `modname` parameter passed to initialize() is the module
name set in the BES Keys BES.modules and BES.module.<mod name>. It is important to be consistent
with this name since it is literally the text string that forms the association between various
parts of the module components. Follow the convention of always using that name in the calls
shown in the example.

== BES Containers and Container Storage
The BES using the abstraction of _Containers_ that hold data to enable all the BES modules
that read data to work with all the different kinds of data stores (files, S3, etc.) the BES
is configured to use. To understand the flow of control the the BES Framework manages,
it is important to understand how instances of BESContainer are used to abstract different
types of data.

=== The components
. A module (a concrete instance of the BESAbstractModule class)
. A container storage object (a specialization of BESContainerStorageVolatile)
. A container object (a concrete instance of BESContainer)
. BES configuration parameters, usually in a `.conf` test file
. An XML command document that includes a `<container name="..." space="...">` element

== BES Lists
[#sec-bes-lists]
The BES uses a number of singleton `*List` classes to manage named collections of objects that
will be used during command planning and evaluation.
