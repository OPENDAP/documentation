== Introduction
This document describes the Back End Server (BES) used by Hyrax to
read data, build response, perform data subsetting operations, and run small
compute tasks that are proximate to data. The BES makes up the lower two tiers
of the Hyrax data server.

The BES software was initially designed and written at the High Altitude Observatory
(HAO) of the University Corporation for Atmosphere Research (UCAR) in the early
2000s by Jose Garcia, Patrick West, and Peter Fox.

.The Hyrax Data Server Architecture
[#img-hyrax-arch]
image::Hyrax-Architecture.svg["Hyrax Architecture"]

The BES Framework and modules shown in <<img-hyrax-arch>> are the subject of this
document. The _Module_ components of the BES are where the data- and response-specific
behavior of the BES are encoded. The _Framework_ is the orchestration engine of the
BES. It interprets a command from the OLFS, plans how to build the requested response
from the named data and how data are passed from one module to another.

In a broad sense, there are two kinds of modules: those that read from a data source
(called a _BESContainer_) and those that build responses. The BES natively supports
the OPeNDAP _DAP2_ and _DAP4_ data protocols as well as an extensible set of file
formats that includes NetCDF3 and 4, JPEG2000, GeoTiff, ASCII/CSV and XML. Modules
can not only read from files on a POSIX file system, but they can read from SQL databases,
S3 and similar Web Object Stores (WOS) and other kinds of remote servers.

== BES Modules and Component Assembly
A module is an instance of BESAbstractModule is linked as a run-time loadable module. For example,
<<#img-nc-module>> shows how the `NCModule` class inherits from the BESAbstractModule class. The
NCModule is the base of the module that reads data from the netCDF3 and 4 files,
see <<src-nc-module>>.

.The NCModule Class
[#img-nc-module]
image::classNCModule__coll__graph.png[NCModule collaboration diagram]

The BES daemon uses the code in the implementation of, e.g., NCModule to initialize
the model at startup. Each specialization of BESAbstractModule should define `initialize()`
and `terminate()`. The initialize() method is used when the module is first loaded. It performs
all the startup actions the module needs. In <<src-nc-module>> the initialize() method makes
some objects and passes those to methods that will add them to BES List (see Section
<<sec-bes-lists>>) classes. The classes
and the Lists are not important right now—know that when a module is loaded, the
initialize() method is run.

When the daemon shuts down, each Module is 'unloaded' and its terminate() method is run. That is
not shown in the listing, but you can find it in the GitHub repo _OPENDAP/bes_ or in the
https://opendap.github.io/bes/html/classes.html[online reference documentation].

=== How Modules are Loaded
In the BES daemon, a _master listener_ is started, the configuration files are read, the BES Keys
(our name for the configuration parameters) are parsed, and all the modules are loaded.
The details of the server startup operations are discussed in Section <<sec-startup>>, BES Startup.

One detail you will need to know, common to all modules, is that an extern C function named `maker()`
must be included. This function is used when the module is loaded to make an instance of the Module
class. Once the instance is made, a pointer to the module is stored in an instance of BESModuleApp.
The BESModuleApp also contains the `loadModules()` method that runs each module's initialize()
method.

=== What You Need to Know About Modules
The process of loading and unloading modules is interesting, but it is performed by parts of the
BES framework that are rarely modified. You need to know that the initialize() and terminate()
methods and the maker() _virtual constructor_ must be included in a Module implementation.

In addition to the code of the module, the correct entries in the BES Keys must be made. To be
loaded, a module must have two BES keys set correctly. The first is that the name of the module
must be included in the comma-separated list of names set to the `BES.modules` key. The module
can have any name (assuming valid syntax) so long as it is not already in use. There is one
Key called BES.Modules for the entire BES. See <<src-mod-keys>>.

The second BES Key is formed using the module name as a suffix to `BES.module`. The value of
this key is full path to the shared object file that holds the module software, and that will
be loaded by the BESModuleApp using the unix/Linux `dload()` system call.

In the example <<src-mod-keys>>, the module name is `nc` so the BES Key that holds the path
of the shared object files is `BES.module.nc`. The one key that lists all the modules is
`BES.modules` (plural) while the key that is unique
for each module is `BES.module.<mod name>` (singular).

[NOTE]
In the <<src-nc-module>> example, the `modname` parameter passed to initialize() is the module
name set in the BES Keys BES.modules and BES.module.<mod name>. It is important to be consistent
with this name since it is literally the text string that forms the association between various
parts of the module components. Follow the convention of always using that name in the calls
shown in the example.

== BES Containers and Container Storage
The BES (Back End Server) defines a Container abstraction to standardize access to data across different storage backends. This modular interface allows data-handling modules to operate independently of where or how the data is stored—whether it's in local files, S3 buckets, or other systems. The design supports extensibility: new storage types can be integrated by implementing the BESContainer interface without modifying core BES logic. Understanding how BESContainer instances encapsulate and expose data is key to following the control flow within the BES Framework.

=== The components
. A module (a concrete instance of the BESAbstractModule class)
. A container storage object (a specialization of BESContainerStorageVolatile)
. A container object (a concrete instance of BESContainer)
. BES configuration parameters, usually in a `.conf` test file
. An XML command document that includes a `<container name="..." space="...">` element

== BES List Classes Overview
[#sec-bes-lists]
[WARNING]
AI wrote the bulk of this text from here onward, so take it with a grain of salt until it has been verified.

The BES (Back End Server) component of the OPeNDAP Hyrax data server uses a family of List classes to manage and orchestrate the various objects involved in processing data requests. These lists are integral to the BES framework's dynamic and extensible architecture, providing a uniform mechanism for storing, retrieving, and iterating over collections of runtime objects such as containers, modules, commands, and request handlers.

=== General Structure and Purpose
BES List classes follow a common pattern: they are typically singleton-like registries that manage named objects, which may be added at runtime through configuration files or dynamically loaded modules. Each List class wraps a map-like structure (often keyed by a string identifier) and provides methods for registration, lookup, and iteration.

Examples include:

- `BESContainerList`
- `BESModuleList`
- `BESCommandList`
- `BESRequestHandlerList`
- `BESInfoList`

These classes provide type-safe access to specific categories of BES components and enforce the lifetime and ownership rules needed by the BES's request/response processing model.

=== Role in BES Orchestration
At a high level, the BES orchestration framework processes requests through the following sequence:

. *Command Dispatching*
A client sends a request containing a command name and associated parameters. The BES uses `BESCommandList` to look up the appropriate command handler (`BESCommand` subclass) and execute it.

. *Container Resolution*
If the command operates on a data object (e.g., a dataset or collection), the BES uses `BESContainerList` to locate the appropriate `BESContainer` instance. These containers abstract access to data regardless of its storage backend (e.g., file system, S3, custom APIs).

. *Module and Handler Discovery*
The actual processing logic (e.g., generating a DAP response) is delegated to a `BESModule`, which may internally use `BESRequestHandler` instances. These are looked up via `BESModuleList` and `BESRequestHandlerList`, respectively.

. *Extensibility via Registration*
During startup or module loading, new objects (containers, modules, commands, etc.) are registered with their respective `*List` classes. This registration mechanism enables plugins to extend the BES at runtime without modifying core code.

=== Concurrency and Lifetime
The `*List` classes are designed to be thread-safe where necessary, typically by enforcing immutable references or by managing concurrent access via internal synchronization. Object lifetimes are often managed via `shared_ptr`, ensuring that list contents are automatically cleaned up when no longer in use.

=== Benefits of the List Pattern in BES

- *Modularity*: Enables dynamic loading and registration of components.
- *Isolation*: Each component is decoupled from the orchestration logic.
- *Extensibility*: New features can be added with minimal changes to the core framework.

=== Core `*List` Classes in BES
The following is a list of major `*List` classes used in the BES framework, along with a short description of their purpose:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Class Name
| Description

| BESContainerList
| Manages instances of BESContainer, which abstract data sources such as files, S3 buckets, or other storage backends. This list allows the BES to resolve and access data containers by name during request processing.

| BESCommandList
| Registers and dispatches BESCommand objects, each representing a specific operation (e.g., Get, Describe, Version). When a client sends a command, the BES uses this list to locate and execute the corresponding handler.

| BESModuleList
| Tracks dynamically loaded modules, including data handlers and processing components. This list supports runtime extensibility by allowing new modules to be registered and integrated without modifying the core BES code.

| BESRequestHandlerList
| Manages BESRequestHandler instances responsible for handling specific types of requests or protocols. This list facilitates the delegation of request processing to appropriate handlers based on the request context.

| BESInfoList
| Holds informational objects that provide metadata about the BES's current state, configuration, and capabilities.

| BESResponseList
| Maintains a collection of response objects generated during request processing. This list ensures that responses are properly managed and delivered back to clients in an organized manner.

| BESDataHandlerList
| Contains data handler instances that interpret and process specific data formats (e.g., NetCDF, HDF). This list enables the BES to select the appropriate handler for a given data source based on its format.

| BESServiceList
| Registers available services that the BES can perform, such as data subsetting or transformation operations. This list allows the BES to advertise and manage the services it offers to clients.

| BESModuleFactoryList
| Manages factories responsible for creating instances of modules. This list supports the dynamic instantiation of modules as needed during request processing.

| BESContainerFactoryList
| Tracks factories that produce BESContainer instances. This list allows the BES to create containers dynamically based on the type of data source being accessed.
|===

These `*List` classes are integral to the BES's modular and extensible architecture. They provide centralized registries for various components, enabling dynamic discovery, registration, and management of the objects involved in processing client requests. By using these lists, the BES can efficiently orchestrate complex workflows, support a wide range of data formats and services, and facilitate the integration of new functionalities with minimal disruption to existing systems.

== BESRequestHandler and BESResponseHandler Overview
[#sec-resp-hand]
The `BESRequestHandler` and `BESResponseHandler` classes are core parts of the BES orchestration framework. They define how the server interprets client requests and delivers responses, enabling flexible protocol handling and output formatting. Together, they form the foundation of how BES connects client commands to output delivery.

=== BESRequestHandler

The `BESRequestHandler` class provides an interface for components that handle the delivery of responses for specific types of BES commands or protocols. These handlers are responsible for executing logic that reads, transforms, and serializes data in response to a client's request.

==== Responsibilities

- Interpret the `BESRequest` object (which includes command and parameters).
- Interact with `BESContainer`, `BESCommand`, and potentially `BESDataHandler` instances.
- Create and populate a `BESResponseObject` (e.g., DAP2 response, error message).
- Register themselves with the `BESRequestHandlerList` under a symbolic name (e.g., `"dap"` or `"dap4"`).

==== Key Methods

[source,cpp]
----
virtual void invoke(const BESRequest& request, BESResponseObject& response) = 0;
----

This pure virtual method is overridden by subclasses to implement the actual request processing logic. It is called by the BES orchestration layer during request dispatch.

==== Example Subclasses

- `BESDapRequestHandler` – handles DAP2 responses
- `BESDmrppRequestHandler` – supports DMR++ output generation
- `BESDap4RequestHandler` – handles DAP4 protocol requests

==== Integration

`BESRequestHandler` instances are registered at runtime with the `BESRequestHandlerList`. The BES uses the symbolic name (often specified by the client or derived from the request path) to locate and invoke the correct handler.

=== BESResponseHandler

The `BESResponseHandler` class defines how response objects are formatted and transmitted to the client. While the `BESRequestHandler` prepares the response content, the `BESResponseHandler` manages the final output step.

This class abstracts the output sink, which might be a socket, a file, or an internal buffer depending on the context (e.g., for testing or aggregation).

==== Responsibilities

- Serialize and write `BESResponseObject` instances.
- Manage output format (e.g., binary, XML, DAP2 DDS/DAS, DAP4 DMR).
- Provide hooks for error formatting and status reporting.

==== Key Methods

[source,cpp]
----
virtual void send_response(const BESResponseObject& response) = 0;
----

The subclass implements this method to define how the response is transmitted or stored.

==== Example Subclasses

- `BESXMLResponseHandler` – emits responses as XML.
- `BESDap2ResponseHandler` – serializes responses in DAP2 format.
- `BESDap4ResponseHandler` – handles DAP4 responses.
- `BESDebugResponseHandler` – outputs responses for diagnostics.

==== Collaboration with Request Handlers

A typical execution flow looks like this:

. A `BESRequestHandler` interprets the request and creates a `BESResponseObject`.
. The BES framework selects a `BESResponseHandler` based on request or configuration context.
. The response handler is invoked to serialize and transmit the response.

=== Summary

Together, `BESRequestHandler` and `BESResponseHandler` encapsulate the BES’s request-response cycle. This separation of concerns allows developers to introduce new protocols and output formats with minimal impact on the rest of the BES framework. It also simplifies testing, as handlers can be independently instantiated and exercised.

== Handler Registration and the Role of `*List` Classes

The Hyrax BES is built around a modular architecture that uses centralized registries—called `*List` classes—to manage pluggable components like commands, containers, and handlers. This design enables dynamic registration and lookup of components at runtime, allowing the server to be easily extended with new functionality.

This section explains how `BESRequestHandler` and `BESResponseHandler` classes are registered with the BES and describes the role of the relevant `*List` classes in that process.

=== The Registration Pattern

All BES components that are dynamically looked up—such as request handlers, commands, and containers—follow a common pattern:

. A derived class (e.g., `MyRequestHandler`) is implemented.
. An instance of the class (or a factory for it) is created at runtime.
. The instance is registered with a `*List` class under a unique string key.
. Later, the BES uses that key to look up and invoke the registered object.

This allows handlers to be selected by name at runtime (often specified in a request or in BES configuration) without hard-coding behavior.

=== Registering a `BESRequestHandler`

Handlers are typically registered in a module’s initialization function, such as:

[source,cpp]
----
void initialize_my_module() {
    BESRequestHandlerList::TheList()->add_handler(
        "myformat", std::make_shared<MyRequestHandler>());
}
----

This call adds a new handler instance to the global `BESRequestHandlerList`, keyed by the string `"myformat"`. Later, when the BES receives a request that maps to `"myformat"`, it retrieves the corresponding handler and invokes it.

==== Relevant `*List` Class

- `BESRequestHandlerList`:
Stores all registered `BESRequestHandler` instances. Provides `add_handler()`, `find_handler()`, and iteration utilities.

=== Registering a `BESResponseHandler`

While request handlers are typically registered globally, response handlers are usually selected contextually during request processing (e.g., based on Accept headers or format parameters). However, some modules do register reusable response handlers:

[source,cpp]
----
BESResponseHandlerList::TheList()->add_handler(
    "dap2", std::make_shared<BESDap2ResponseHandler>());
----

This makes the handler available for use during response dispatching.

==== Relevant `*List` Class

- `BESResponseHandlerList`:
Stores response handler objects. It supports registration and lookup via symbolic names, enabling dynamic selection of output serializers.

=== Invocation During Request Processing

The orchestration flow tying all of this together looks like this:

. The client sends a request indicating a command and possibly a format or protocol.
. The BES parses the request and uses `BESCommandList` to find the correct `BESCommand`.
. The command, in turn, invokes the appropriate `BESRequestHandler` via `BESRequestHandlerList`.
. The handler generates a `BESResponseObject`, which is serialized using a `BESResponseHandler` from `BESResponseHandlerList`.

This modular structure means that:

- You can introduce new protocols by subclassing `BESRequestHandler` and registering it.
- You can support new output formats by subclassing `BESResponseHandler`.
- You can integrate these without touching core BES code.

=== Summary

The `*List` classes act as dynamic registries that decouple the BES framework from specific implementations of request or response logic. This pattern:

- Simplifies extensibility
- Encourages separation of concerns
- Enables runtime flexibility

For developers, understanding how to register and retrieve components from `*List` classes is key to effectively extending or customizing the BES.

== Example: Registering a Custom BESRequestHandler and BESResponseHandler

This example demonstrates how to implement and register a custom `BESRequestHandler` and `BESResponseHandler` in a BES module. This pattern is useful for introducing new protocols, data access methods, or response formats.

=== Step 1: Implement a Custom Request Handler

[source,cpp]
----
#include "BESRequestHandler.h"
#include "BESResponseObject.h"
#include <iostream>

class MyCustomRequestHandler : public BESRequestHandler {
public:
    MyCustomRequestHandler() = default;
    virtual ~MyCustomRequestHandler() = default;

    void invoke(const BESRequest &request, BESResponseObject &response) override {
        std::string msg = "Handled request by MyCustomRequestHandler\n";
        response.append_output(msg); // Add content to response stream
    }

    std::string name() const override {
        return "MyCustomRequestHandler";
    }

    void dump(std::ostream &strm) const override {
        strm << "MyCustomRequestHandler: handles custom format requests";
    }
};
----

=== Step 2: Implement a Custom Response Handler

[source,cpp]
----
#include "BESResponseHandler.h"
#include "BESResponseObject.h"

class MyCustomResponseHandler : public BESResponseHandler {
public:
    MyCustomResponseHandler() = default;
    virtual ~MyCustomResponseHandler() = default;

    void send_response(const BESResponseObject &response) override {
        std::cout << "== Custom Response Start ==" << std::endl;
        std::cout << response.get_output();  // Dump content to stdout (or a real output stream)
        std::cout << "== Custom Response End ==" << std::endl;
    }

    std::string name() const override {
        return "MyCustomResponseHandler";
    }

    void dump(std::ostream &strm) const override {
        strm << "MyCustomResponseHandler: formats output for custom format";
    }
};
----

=== Step 3: Register the Handlers in a Module Init Function

Create an initialization function that will be called when your module is loaded by the BES.

[source,cpp]
----
#include "BESRequestHandlerList.h"
#include "BESResponseHandlerList.h"

extern "C" void initialize_my_custom_module() {
    // Register request handler
    BESRequestHandlerList::TheList()->add_handler(
        "custom", std::make_shared<MyCustomRequestHandler>());

    // Register response handler
    BESResponseHandlerList::TheList()->add_handler(
        "custom", std::make_shared<MyCustomResponseHandler>());
}
----

You would typically build this code into a shared object (`.so` or `.dylib`) and configure the BES to load it using a `.mod` file or `bes.conf` entry like:

[source]
----
module: my_custom_module /path/to/libmy_custom_module.so
----

=== Step 4: Using the Handlers

Once registered, your handlers can be triggered by client requests that specify `"custom"` as the protocol or response format, depending on how you hook into the BES command logic.

For example, a request like:

----
http://server/opendap/data.dap?handler=custom
----

Could be routed to `MyCustomRequestHandler`, and the output would be formatted by `MyCustomResponseHandler`.

=== Summary

This pattern allows you to cleanly extend the BES with new functionality:

- Define the logic in subclasses of `BESRequestHandler` and `BESResponseHandler`.
- Register them at module initialization using the appropriate `*List` class.
- Trigger them using symbolic names in client requests or internal configuration.

This modular design supports protocol evolution, experimentation, and third-party extension without modifying core BES code.

== BESTransmitter Class Hierarchy
[#sec-bes-trans]

The `BESTransmitter` class hierarchy is a critical part of the OPeNDAP BES (Back End Server) architecture. It defines how response data—generated by request handlers and serialized by response handlers—is ultimately **delivered to the client** or output stream. While `BESRequestHandler` and `BESResponseHandler` define what content should be produced and how it should be formatted, the `BESTransmitter` controls **where and how that data is sent**.

=== Purpose

`BESTransmitter` provides an abstraction layer between the internal BES processing pipeline and the output mechanism. This allows BES to deliver output:

- To standard output (e.g., for CGI-mode operation)
- Through a network socket (e.g., in BES Daemon mode)
- To a file (e.g., for testing or debugging)
- To a memory buffer (e.g., for aggregating or chaining handlers)

=== Base Class: `BESTransmitter`

The `BESTransmitter` base class defines the virtual interface for transmitting response content.

==== Key Responsibilities

- Accept the output produced by a `BESResponseHandler`
- Manage the underlying output stream
- Ensure proper lifecycle of the output resource (e.g., open/close socket)

==== Important Methods

[source,cpp]
----
class BESTransmitter {
public:
    virtual std::ostream& output_stream() = 0;
    virtual void flush() = 0;
    virtual void close() = 0;

    virtual void dump(std::ostream &strm) const = 0;
    virtual std::string name() const = 0;

    virtual ~BESTransmitter() = default;
};
----

These methods provide a consistent interface for writing and managing response data. Implementations wrap the actual destination (e.g., `std::cout`, a socket, a file).

=== Common Subclasses

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Class
| Description

| `BESStdoutTransmitter`
| Sends output to `stdout`. Often used in CGI-based deployments of Hyrax.

| `BESSocketTransmitter`
| Sends output through a socket. Used when BES runs in daemon mode (e.g., with a front-end server like `besd`).

| `BESTestTransmitter`
| Captures output in a stringstream or temporary buffer for unit testing or diagnostic logging.

| `BESFileTransmitter`
| Writes response output to a file. Useful in batch jobs or for intermediate result capture.

| `BESMemoryTransmitter`
| Stores response in memory, often used internally for transformation or chaining.
|===

=== Integration with Response Handling

A typical request-response flow involving a `BESTransmitter` looks like this:

. A request arrives at the BES and is handled by a `BESRequestHandler`.
. The handler generates a `BESResponseObject` containing response content.
. A `BESResponseHandler` serializes this content to an output stream.
. The stream is provided by a concrete `BESTransmitter` instance.
. Once output is complete, `flush()` and `close()` are called on the transmitter.

This separation of concerns allows the BES to adapt its output mechanism to different deployment scenarios without modifying its response logic.

=== Custom Transmitters

Developers can subclass `BESTransmitter` to implement new output mechanisms. For example, output could be:

- Pushed to an HTTP/2 stream
- Enqueued into a message bus
- Written into a shared memory segment for IPC

To implement a custom transmitter, override the key methods (`output_stream()`, `flush()`, `close()`) and register or configure it in the BES runtime environment.

[source,cpp]
----
class MyTransmitter : public BESTransmitter {
private:
    std::ostringstream buffer;

public:
    std::ostream& output_stream() override {
        return buffer;
    }

    void flush() override {
        // Optionally send or store the buffer content
    }

    void close() override {
        // Clean up or finalize delivery
    }

    void dump(std::ostream &strm) const override {
        strm << "MyTransmitter: buffered output example";
    }

    std::string name() const override {
        return "MyTransmitter";
    }
};
----

=== Summary

The `BESTransmitter` class hierarchy abstracts **how response content is delivered** from the BES to the outside world. It is a vital component in the modular architecture of Hyrax BES, enabling deployment flexibility, testability, and extensibility in response delivery.

Understanding and leveraging `BESTransmitter` is essential for:

- Writing custom BES output modules
- Supporting new communication protocols
- Debugging or testing BES components

== Example: Custom BESTransmitter for In-Memory Output

This example shows how to create and use a custom `BESTransmitter` subclass that captures output in a `std::ostringstream`. This is especially useful for unit testing or chaining output into another system.

=== Step 1: Implement a Custom Transmitter

[source,cpp]
----
#include "BESTransmitter.h"
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

class MyBufferTransmitter : public BESTransmitter {
private:
    std::ostringstream d_buffer;

public:
    std::ostream& output_stream() override {
        return d_buffer;
    }

    void flush() override {
        // In a real use case, this might push to a message queue or HTTP API
    }

    void close() override {
        std::cerr << "MyBufferTransmitter closed. Output size = "
                  << d_buffer.str().size() << " bytes." << std::endl;
    }

    std::string get_output() const {
        return d_buffer.str();
    }

    void dump(std::ostream &strm) const override {
        strm << "MyBufferTransmitter: captures output in-memory.";
    }

    std::string name() const override {
        return "MyBufferTransmitter";
    }
};
----

=== Step 2: Create a Test Harness Using the Transmitter

Below is a simplified harness that invokes a `BESRequestHandler` using your custom transmitter.

[source,cpp]
----
#include "BESRequestHandlerList.h"
#include "BESResponseHandlerList.h"
#include "BESResponseObject.h"
#include "BESRequest.h"

void run_custom_test() {
    // Simulate a BES request (normally parsed from a client request)
    BESRequest request("custom");  // Uses handler named 'custom'
    BESResponseObject response;

    // Look up a registered request handler
    std::shared_ptr<BESRequestHandler> handler =
        BESRequestHandlerList::TheList()->find_handler("custom");

    if (!handler) {
        std::cerr << "Handler not found for 'custom'" << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    // Run the handler to generate response content
    handler->invoke(request, response);

    // Set up custom transmitter
    MyBufferTransmitter tx;

    // Serialize the response using a registered response handler
    std::shared_ptr<BESResponseHandler> response_handler =
        BESResponseHandlerList::TheList()->find_handler("custom");

    if (response_handler) {
        // Redirect response stream to custom transmitter
        response.set_transmitter(&tx);

        response_handler->send_response(response);
        tx.flush();
        tx.close();

        // Use captured output for inspection, chaining, or forwarding
        std::string captured = tx.get_output();
        std::cout << "=== Captured Response ===\n" << captured << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "No response handler for 'custom'" << std::endl;
    }
}

=== Step 3: Run in a Test Environment

Make sure the `"custom"` request and response handlers are registered via your module’s `initialize_XXX()` function before calling `run_custom_test()`.

Example:

[source,cpp]
----
int main() {
    initialize_my_custom_module(); // Registers the handlers
    run_custom_test();
    return 0;
}
----

This setup avoids the need for a full BES daemon or HTTP front-end and is ideal for unit testing or functional test coverage of custom handlers.

=== Summary

This example demonstrates how to:

- Subclass `BESTransmitter` to intercept or redirect BES output.
- Integrate your transmitter with the BES orchestration flow.
- Use the mechanism in a standalone test harness for isolated testing.

This same approach can be extended to transmit responses to:
- Remote APIs
- Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)
- Databases
- Embedded analysis pipelines

== BES Daemon and Master Listener Architecture
[#sec-startup]

The Back-End Server (BES) of the OPeNDAP Hyrax data server is designed to handle data requests efficiently and securely. The BES operates as a daemon process, initiating master listener processes to manage incoming client connections. This modular architecture allows for scalable and maintainable server operations.

=== Core Classes Involved in BES Startup

The startup sequence of the BES daemon and its master listener processes involves several key classes:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Class
| Description

| `BESDaemon`
| The main class responsible for initializing the BES daemon. It sets up the server environment, parses configuration files, and starts the master listener processes.

| `BESMasterListener`
| Manages the listening sockets for incoming client connections. It accepts new connections and delegates them to worker processes or threads for handling.

| `BESProcessManager`
| Oversees the lifecycle of worker processes or threads that handle client requests. It ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and that processes are recycled as needed.

| `BESConfiguration`
| Parses and stores configuration parameters from the `bes.conf` file, such as port numbers, user/group settings, and module paths.

| `BESModuleLoader`
| Dynamically loads BES modules specified in the configuration, allowing for extensible functionality without modifying the core server code.
|===

=== Startup Sequence Overview

1. **Initialization**: The `BESDaemon` class is instantiated, initializing the server environment and reading configuration settings via the `BESConfiguration` class.

2. **Module Loading**: The `BESModuleLoader` loads all specified modules, registering available commands, handlers, and services.

3. **Listener Setup**: The `BESMasterListener` sets up TCP/IP and/or UNIX domain sockets based on configuration parameters, preparing the server to accept incoming connections.

4. **Process Management**: The `BESProcessManager` initializes the pool of worker processes or threads that will handle client requests.

5. **Daemonization**: The server process detaches from the terminal and runs in the background as a daemon, continuously listening for and handling client requests.

=== UML Class Diagram

Below is a simplified UML class diagram illustrating the relationships between the core classes involved in the BES startup process:

}

class BESConfiguration {

class BESProcessManager {
    + initializeWorkers()
    + manageWorkerLifecycle()
}

=== Configuration Parameters

The `bes.conf` file contains critical parameters that influence the behavior of the BES daemon and its listeners:

- `BES.ServerPort`: Specifies the TCP port on which the BES listens for incoming connections.

- `BES.ServerUnixSocket`: Defines the path for the UNIX domain socket, if used.

- `BES.User` and `BES.Group`: Determine the user and group under which the BES process runs, enhancing security by dropping root privileges after startup.

- `BES.ProcessManagerMethod`: Sets the process management strategy (`single` or `multiple`), controlling how the BES handles concurrent connections.

- `BES.Modules`: Lists the modules to be loaded at startup, enabling dynamic extension of server capabilities.

=== Security Considerations

- **Privilege Dropping**: The BES daemon starts with root privileges to bind to low-numbered ports or create UNIX domain sockets, then drops to a less-privileged user as specified in the configuration.

- **Module Isolation**: By dynamically loading modules, the BES ensures that each module operates within its own namespace, reducing the risk of cross-module interference.

- **Connection Handling**: The `BESMasterListener` can be configured to use secure sockets (e.g., SSL/TLS) to encrypt client-server communications, protecting data in transit.

=== Extensibility

The modular design of the BES allows developers to add new functionality by creating and registering modules without altering the core server code. This is facilitated by the `BESModuleLoader`, which loads modules specified in the configuration at runtime.

=== Summary

The BES daemon and its master listener processes are orchestrated through a series of well-defined classes that manage configuration, module loading, connection handling, and process management. This architecture provides a robust, secure, and extensible foundation for serving data in the Hyrax data server.
